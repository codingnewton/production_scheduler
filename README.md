# Film Production Scheduler
### Overview
This project provides an optimization model for scheduling film production tasks, assigning crews to tasks, and minimizing production costs. 
The first method uses integer programming to find the optimal schedule that respects all constraints while keeping production costs low.
The second method is genetic algorithm to search for an good enough optimal schedule that respects all constraints while keeping productioin costs low.
